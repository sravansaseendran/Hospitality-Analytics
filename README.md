# Hospitality-Analytics
Developed an interactive Hospitality Analytics Dashboard to analyze hotel performance and support data-driven decision-making across multiple properties and cities. The project focuses on transforming raw booking and revenue data into meaningful business insights.

Tools & Technologies
- Excel (Data cleaning, analysis & Dashboard)
- Power BI (Dashboard & visualization)
- SQL (Data querying)
- Tableau (Dashboard & visualization)

 Key Analysis Areas
- Revenue and booking trends
- Occupancy performance
- City and property level analysis
- Weekly and monthly performance trends

Key Outcomes
- Built an interactive Power BI dashboard
- Identified performance patterns and business insights
- Improved data-driven reporting approach

Findings:
	
	The cancellation rate is very high at 24.83%, causing revenue instability and poor capacity planning.
	Occupancy is low at 57.87%, indicating many rooms remain unoccupied.
	Some properties perform poor in revenue, bookings, and ratings, creating inconsistency across the portfolio.
	Monthly revenue is declining from May to July, revealing seasonal or strategic weaknesses.
	Weekend revenue and bookings are much lower than weekday levels, showing over-dependence on business travelers.
	The average guest rating of 3.62 suggests only moderate customer satisfaction and inconsistent service quality.
    The business heavily relies on a few booking platforms, increasing risk and commission expenses.
   Revenue performance varies widely by city, with some cities underperforming compared to strong markets like Mumbai and Bangalore.
   Room category demand is uneven, with certain room types performing much better than others, indicating pricing or promotion misalignment.

Solutions to overcome challenges :
	
	Introduce tiered cancellation policies, take partial advance payments, send automated pre-arrival reminders, and offer incentives (loyalty points or complimentary service , discounts)for non-refundable bookings to reduce the high cancellation rate.
	Use dynamic pricing, provide early-bird and last-minute offers, strengthen digital marketing, and partner with corporates for long-stay contracts to improve overall occupancy.
